# Streamlit Theme Generator 👩‍🎨️

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/jrieke/streamlit-theme-generator/main)

**Generate beautiful color themes for Streamlit, powered by [colormind.io](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/).**

[Theming in Streamlit](https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-theming/) is awesome but
it's often hard to pick colors that match. This app generates beautiful color
palettes through [colormind.io](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/)
and applies them live to it's Streamlit theme. Just generate themes until you
find one you like and copy it to your own Streamlit app!
